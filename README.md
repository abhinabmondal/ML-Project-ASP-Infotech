# 🎯 Object Detection using Python & ML Libraries

This repository contains the Machine Learning Project on Object Detection, developed during my internship at ASP-InfoTech Pvt. Ltd, Durgapur, West Bengal.

The project was a group project, carried out under the guidance of Mr. Harishankar Chatterjee.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Object Detection is a critical application of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, widely used in:

🛡️ Security & Surveillance

🚗 Autonomous Vehicles

🏭 Industrial Automation

📱 Smart Applications

Key project highlights:

📸 Preprocessed image datasets for training and testing

🧠 Implemented ML & DL-based object detection models

📦 Used Python libraries for feature extraction and prediction

📊 Evaluated model accuracy and detection performance

🔎 Visualized bounding boxes and labels on detected objects
